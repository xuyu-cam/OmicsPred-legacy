export const home = `OMICSPRED: An atlas of genetic scores for prediction of multi-omics data
OMICSPRED is a resource for predicting multi-omics data (proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics etc.) directly from genotypes. To do this, we have used a single cohort (INTERVAL) with extensive multi-omics data to train genetic scores using machine learning. Here, you can explore and download the genetic scores for a wide range of biomolecular traits in human blood as well as the summary statistics of their associations with key traits and diseases in the UK Biobank.

Genetic scores were trained on the INTERVAL cohort usingBayesian Ridge regression. Validation was performed on independent individuals from other cohorts or on withheld subsets of INTERVAL (more info below). Detailed methods and validation steps can be found here .
2,384 protein genetic scores, validated on the FENLAND,MEC andJHS cohorts


308 protein genetic scores, validated on the NSPHS andORCADES cohorts


726 metabolite genetic scores, validated on a withheld subset of INTERVAL and ORCADES cohort

Genetic scores for 141 metabolic traits, validated on UK Biobank, ORCADES andVIKING cohorts

Transcriptomics (whole blood)
13,668 gene expression genetic scores, validated on a withheld subset of INTERVAL.

A PHENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS IN UK BIOBANK
Genetic scores in OMICSPRED have been applied toUK biobank to test for associations with complex phenotypes.

QUANTIFYING GENETIC CONTROL OF PATHWAYS
Genetic scores for proteomics were applied to assess the extent to which biological pathways are genetically controlled using data atReactome.

OMICSPRED is under active development, and we will continue to add genetic scores. If you use OMICSPRED in your research, we ask that you cite our submitted ASHG 2021 abstract for now (below). A full manuscript is in preparation and is anticipated to be preprinted in Q1 2022.
