A follow-up LD thinning step was carried out at an r2 threshold of 0.8 on all the variants, which aims to remove a certrain level of LD dependencies among variants and reduce the computational burden of genetic scoring method. The remaining variants were then filtered at the genome-wide significance threshold of 5e-8 (based on their GWAS summary statistics conducted on the INTERVAL training samples) for each trait. ",
